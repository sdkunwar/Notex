# Keystore configuration for NoteX release builds
#
# IMPORTANT: For local development, copy this file and create your own keystore.
# For CI/CD, these values should be set as GitHub secrets.
#
# To generate a new keystore, run:
# keytool -genkey -v -keystore notex-release.jks -alias notex -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
#
# For open source projects, you may want to include a public keystore.
# This is safe because anyone can verify signatures but not forge them.
